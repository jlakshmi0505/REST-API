#REST API

Used Google Places API Web Service to fetch information about tourist attractions near the hotels.  Specifically, for each hotel in in the provided json files (hotels1.json and hotels4.json), we need to find a list of tourist attractions within a certain radius from it. 
Then, we will scrape hotel html pages downloaded from Expedia to get property and area descriptions.
