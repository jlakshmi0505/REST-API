# Project 5

Due date: November 1, 2019

Project 5 consists of two parts:

- Part 1: First, you will first use Google Places API Web Service to fetch information about tourist attractions near the hotels.  Specifically, for each hotel in in the provided json files (hotels1.json and hotels4.json), you need to find a list of tourist attractions within a certain radius from it. 
- Part 2: Then, you will scrape hotel html pages downloaded from Expedia to get property and area descriptions.

Please see course webpage on Canvas for description.
